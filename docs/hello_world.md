# Hello World!
In this tutorial we will teach you how to print Hello World!<br>
Every programmer starts here and works their way up.<br><br>

Our first line of code will be
```
import std
```
This lets us use the standard library which has the print function.<br>
A very simple explanation of a library is that it extends the functionality<br>
of the programming language.<br><br>

Now we have that done that we need a main function and this<br>
is where your code starts when run your code should now look like this:
```
import std

func main()
end
```

Finally we now need to use the print function and this lets us<br>
print text to the terminal/console window.

## End Result
```
import std

func main()
  print("Hello World")
end
```
