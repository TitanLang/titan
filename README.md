## What is Titan
It is a programming language wrote in C designed to look clean.<br>
Titan doesn't aim to try and reinvent the wheel but gains and identity<br>
for a very mixed bag of syntax inspired by Ruby, Zig, Rust and C.<br>

<br>

## What I want to change
In the future once the basic syntax is complete I will move Titan to Rust<br>
As of right now it is built on a compiler called chibiic which is a small compiler<br>
but I would like to move to our own code and not just be a fork.
